The dataset used includes detailed information about customers, transactions, products, geographic locations, and temporal data. This dataset consists of attributes such as customer ID, name, email, phone, address, city, state, zip code, country, age, gender, customer segment, date of last purchase, total purchase, amount spent, product category, product brand, product type, feedback, shipping method, payment method, and order status.

"I have extensive experience in designing and implementing intuitive and informative analytics dashboards, as seen in my last project for IKEA. In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes sales data in real-time, enabling quick and informed decisions based on current sales trends and order status. The dashboard includes in-depth analysis of sales by product category, order status, and monthly profit, as well as monitoring the progress of achieving annual targets".

My expertise in turning big and complex data into actionable insights has helped IKEA optimize their sales operations and strategies.

## Project Description

The project aims to develop an interactive dashboard that presents a comprehensive analysis of retail transaction data. The dashboard is designed to help management understand business performance based on various metrics and segments, and make informed decisions based on insights derived from the data.

Contribution:

- Identify Sales Trends: Understand sales patterns by product category, order status, and time period.

- Analyzing Customer Segments: Categorize customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior for a more targeted marketing strategy.

- Understand Geographic Preferences: Know the highest-selling regions and favorite products in different regions.

- Optimize Delivery and Payment Methods: Analyze customer preferences regarding delivery and payment methods to improve operational efficiency.

- Measuring Customer Satisfaction: Track customer feedback and order status to identify areas of improvement.

## Data Analysis Process
Data Preprocessing:

Handle null values and duplicate rows.
Parsing and formatting temporal data.
Coding categorical variables.
Scaling numerical variables if required.
Dividing data into training and testing sets for modeling.

Customer Segmentation Analysis:
Grouping customers by demographics (age, gender, location) and purchase behavior (total purchases, amount spent, feedback).

Sales Trend Analysis:
Identify peak seasons and sales trends based on temporal data (year, month, date).
Calculate total sales and profit based on product category and order status.

Product Performance Analysis:
Determine popular product categories, brands or types.
Analyze monthly profits for each product category.

Geographic Analysis:
Identify regional preferences and trends based on the geographical location of customers.

Shipping and Payment Method Analysis:
Analyze the shipping and payment methods most frequently used by customers.

Customer Satisfaction Analysis:
Track customer feedback and order status to measure satisfaction levels and identify areas of improvement.

## Dashboard Visualization

The resulting dashboard features interactive 
visualizations that include:
Total Sales by Category Product and Order Status: A bar chart showing total sales by product category and order status (Delivered, Pending, Processing, Shipped).

Gauge Chart: Shows total sales for the year.
Income by Order Status: A horizontal bar chart showing income by order status (Delivered, Shipped, Processing, Pending).

Profit of Month by Category Product: A line chart showing monthly profit by product category (Books, Electronics, Clothing, Grocery).

## Conclusion
This dashboard provides a powerful tool for retail transaction data analysis, allowing management to make more informed decisions based on the insights gained. With interactive features and informative visualizations, this dashboard helps in understanding business performance in depth and identifying areas for improvement.

## Development Potential
Integration with real-time data sources for more up-to-date analysis.

Application of machine learning algorithms for more sophisticated sales prediction and customer segmentation.

Addition of sentiment analysis from customer feedback to understand customer perspectives more deeply.

With this project, I believe I can make a significant contribution in helping the company achieve its business targets and improve customer satisfaction.
